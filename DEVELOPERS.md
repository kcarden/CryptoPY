# CryptoPY Developer's Guide

Welcome to the CryptoPY Developer's Guide! We're excited to have you join our community of developers and traders, working together to redefine crypto trading with customizable plugins.

## Getting Started

To get started as a CryptoPY developer, follow these steps:

1. **Fork the Repository:** Begin by forking the main CryptoPY repository to your GitHub account. This will create a copy of the repository under your account, where you can freely work on your contributions.

2. **Clone the Repository:** After forking, clone the repository to your local development environment using the following command:

## git clone https://github.com/your-username/CryptoPY.git

3. **Set Up the Development Environment:** Create a virtual environment for CryptoPY and install the necessary dependencies:

``` cd CryptoPY ```

``` python -m venv venv ```

``` source venv/bin/activate ```

``` # On Windows, use: venv\Scripts\activate ```

``` pip install -r requirements.txt ```


4. **Explore the Codebase:** Familiarize yourself with the project's structure, modules, and existing plugins. The main code resides in `main.py`.

5. **Write Your Plugin:** Ready to unleash your creativity? Create your custom plugin by following the guidelines in the [Plugin Development Guide](DEVELOPERS_GUIDE.md).

## Plugin Development Guide

In CryptoPY, plugins are at the heart of the platform, enabling you to customize and extend the functionality. Here's a brief guide to creating your own plugin:

1. **Plugin Structure:** A plugin is a Python script located in the `plugins` directory. Name your plugin script with a meaningful and descriptive filename.

2. **Plugin Function:** Each plugin must include a function that defines its main functionality. Consider starting with a function named `flashing_text()`.

3. **Interacting with the Framework:** Plugins can access the core functionality of CryptoPY through the provided APIs. Use these APIs to interact with exchanges, data sources, or external services.

4. **Testing Your Plugin:** Before sharing your plugin with the community, ensure that it functions correctly and adheres to best practices.
